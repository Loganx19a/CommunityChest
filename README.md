# About:
This web application supports a non-profit initiative known as "Community Chest," aimed at ensuring the widespread availability of small charitable items through the use of repurposed newspaper dispensers. These dispensers will be strategically located throughout Manhattan on properties owned by partner businesses and organizations, enabling people to both donate and receive goods. 

Key features of the "Community Chest" application include:  

+ A card layout of maps that enable users to locate nearby donation boxes.  
+ A function that allows recipients to post their specific needs/requests for particular items and associate them with the boxes in their vicinity.  
+ A mechanism for donors to acknowledge these requests by marking them as fulfilled after they've deposited items at the respective boxes.  

This project is currently under consideration by various charitable organizations in Manhattan.
